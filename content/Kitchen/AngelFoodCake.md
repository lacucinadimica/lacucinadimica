# Angel Food Cake 

I use <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/angel-food-cake/" target="_blank"> this recipe</a> with a couple of tweaks. 

## Ingredients
- 12 egg whites
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cream tartar (or some fresh lemon juice)
- 1 and 3/4 cups (350 grams) granulated sugar
- Splash of vanilla extract
- 1 cup + 2 tablespoons (133 grams) cake flour
- Pinch of salt


## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C).
- In a mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites and cream tartar on low speed at first, increasing the speed after a couple of minutes. Slowly add 100 grams (0.5 cups) of the fine sugar, in "rain" form. Add the vanilla extract and mix for 1 more minute. You want to get soft peaks, not meringue.

- In 4-5 additions, sift the flour, salt, and rest of the sugar into the egg whites, gently folding with a rubber spatula.
- Pour the batter into an ungreased 9-inch pan or a muffin pan. It'll make around 15 normal-sized muffins.
- Bake until a toothpick comes out clean. It's around 20 minutes for muffins and 45 minutes for a cake.
- To cool down the cake, flip it upside-down on a wire rack for a few hours, until completely cool. Running a knife around the edges will release the cake.
- Note: whipped heavy cream and berries would be perfect toppings.
