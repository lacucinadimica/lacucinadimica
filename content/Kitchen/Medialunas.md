Medialunas are Argentinian croissants known for their fluffiness, butteriness, and sweetness. They are easier to make than French croissants, but they do require patience. Just keep in mind that at any point you can let the dough rest for longer than advised (like overnight) and continue the process later on.

All the foldings are "letter" folds or "simple" folds, which means folding the dough into thirds like a letter, bringing one long side to the center and then folding the other side over that, creating three layers.

I use <a href="https://isabelvermal.com/medialunas-de-manteca/" target="_blank"> this recipe</a>. She has a detailed [video](https://youtu.be/gpVHElzSebg) I recommend if you haven't made puff pastry before. 

I also made a short fun video that you can watch [here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C459vd6uJ3v/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).


**Tips**
- When making this type of flaky pastries, we always roll in the direction of the layers/openings of the dough.
- I also really like to cut them in half and make a ham and cheese sandwich with them.

## Ingredients
### Dough (Détrempe)
- 500 grams all purpose flour 
- 10 grams salt
- 80 grams sugar
- 300 mililiters cold whole milk
- 7 grams active dry yeast
- 30 grams honey
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Butter Layer (Beurrage)
- 200 grams unsalted room-temperature butter
- 25 grams of all-purpose flour

### Egg Wash
- 1 egg 
- A pinch of salt

### Syrup
- 200 grams granulates sugar
- 20 grams honey
- 180 grams water


## Instructions
1. We start by making the Détrempe, either by hand or with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. In a large bowl combine the flour, salt, and sugar.
2. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the milk, yeast, honey, and vanilla extract. The milk must be cold because we don't want to activate the yeast. Stir until the ingredients are combined.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for until smooth (5-7 minutes).
5. Roll the dough with a rolling pin into rectangular shape. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
6. Make sure your butter is at room temperature and combine it with the flour. You can use the stand mixer with the paddle attachment here too.
7. Place the butter block between two sheets of plastic wrap and roll out into a rectangle.
9. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

10. Get the dough from the fridge. Keep rolling into a rectangle big enough that you can put the butter layer on it and fold the dough over to enclose it. Make sure the butter block is cold before folding it to help prevent the butter from melting and making the dough greasy.
11. Gently roll out the dough again into a rectangle.
12. Now the folding begins. Fold the dough into thirds like a letter (bringing one side to the center and then folding the other side over that, creating three layers). This is the first out of three folds (1/3). Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. 
13. Place the dough in a lightly floured surface, roll it, and do another letter fold (2/3). Cover and refrigerate for for at least one hour.
14. Roll the dough and do the last letter fold (3/3). Cover and refrigerate for for at least one hour.
15. Place the dough in a lightly floured surface and roll it into a rectangle. Cut the sides that are too uneven.
16. Cut the dough in half the long way and then in triangles. Place the triangles in a pan, cover in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for yet another hour.
17. Grab a non-stick or lightly greased baking sheet .
18. Take the rectangles out of the fridge and let them rest for 5 minutes.
19. Gently and just barely roll a triangle. Roll the triangle in itself tightly, by pulling the tip with one hand and rolling the dough with the other. Shape it like a "medialuna", a "half-moon". Place each medialuna with the tip of the triangle at the bottom, so they don't open during baking. 
20. Repeat step 19 with each triangle.
21. Cover the baking sheet and let them rest until they double in size. A warm place could be inside the oven with the oven light on. It can take more than 2 hours.
22. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
23. Beat an egg with a pinch of salt, and brush each medialuna with the egg wash.
24. Bake them for 18-20 minutes until they are golden brown.
25. While they bake, put the sugar, honey, and water in a small pot and bring it to a boil to make a syrup. Once it boild and the sugar is dissolved, remove frmo the heat.
26. Right when the medialunas are out of the oven, brush them with the syrup. Brush them twice, because why not.
