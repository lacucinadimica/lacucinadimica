# Mirta's Crust
This is a key crust to learn for making pies, tarts, and empanadas. It can be flaky if folded enough, and it tastes great.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (if you use whole wheat it won't be flaky, but it still works).
- 1/4 cup oil (any vegetable oil works, but I recommend sunflower).
- 1/2 cup boiling water. 
- Some cornstarch for rolling the dough. 
- Salt.

## Procedure
1. Simply combine the flour, oil, water, and salt. Form a dough.
2. Roll the dough using cornstarch (**do not** use flour).
3. Roll and fold the dough multiple times. The more you roll and fold it, the flakier it will be.
4. Use a metal pan for baking it. You can use high heat if needed, depending on what you use the crust for!
