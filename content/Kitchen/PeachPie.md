    <h1>Peach Pie</h1>
    <p>I had never made a peach pie before this recipe, but I loved how it turned out. It's <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/peach-pie-recipe/#tasty-recipes-66823" target="_blank">Sally's Perfect Peach Pie</a> with a couple of tweaks, of course.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://lacucinadimica.com/Kitchen/ButteryFlakyCrust" target="_blank">This Buttery Flaky Crust</a>, which requires:
            <ul>
                <li>300 grams all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>200 grams cold unsalted butter</li>
                <li>125 cubic centimeters cold water (ice-cold)</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>8-9 peaches</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 egg for brushing the crust</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the <a href="https://lacucinadimica.com/Kitchen/ButteryFlakyCrust" target="_blank">Buttery Flaky Crust</a>, shape it into two disks, and refrigerate them. You can do this ahead of time!</li>
        <li>Peel the peaches and cut them into approximately 1-inch chunks, not slices. You can also do this ahead of time and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll one of the crust disks into a circle and place it into a 9-inch pan. Refrigerate it while you prepare the filling.
            <ul>
                <li>Note: To roll into a circle, rotate the disk a quarter turn after every couple of rolls. So, roll the disk twice, rotate it a quarter turn, roll twice again, rotate again, and so on.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For the filling, combine the peach chunks, lemon juice, and sugar in a bowl. Then, stir in the flour and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the pan and refrigerate again while you prepare the top crust.</li>
        <li>Get the other disk from the fridge and roll it on a floured surface. Create a lattice by cutting strips or just top the pie with a full crust circle, it's up to you!</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush the crust. You can also sprinkle some coarse sugar on top.</li>
        <li>Bake it at 425°F for 20 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Bake it for another 45-50 minutes. If the top is getting too brown, place a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the pie.</li>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven, place it on a rack, and let it cool (!). Try to give it 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with ice cream :)</li>
    </ol>
