# Peach Pie 

I had never made peach pie before this recipe and I loved it. It's <a href="[https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/peach-pie-recipe/#tasty-recipes-66823)" target="_blank">Sally's Perfect Peach Pie</a> with a couple of tweaks, of course.

## Ingredients
* This Buttery Flaky Crust
  * 300 grams of all-purpose flour
  * 200 grams of cold unsalted butter
  * 125 cubic centimeters of cold water (like ice-cold)
  * Salt
* 8-9 peaches
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 egg for brushing the crust

## Procedure
1. Make the Buttery Flaky Crust, shape in two disks, and refrigerate them. You can do this ahead of time! 
2. Peel the peaches and cut them into chuncks, approximately 1-inch chunks, not slices. You can also do this ahead of time and refrigerate.
3. Pre-heat the oven to 425°F (220°C) .
4. On a floured surface, roll out one of the crust disks into a circle and place it into a 9-inch pan. Refrigerate it while you prepare the filling
  * Note: to roll into a circle, you have to rotate the disk a quarter of the full turn after a couple of rolls. So, roll the disk twice, rotate it a quarter turn, roll twice again, rotate again, and so on.
5. For the filling, combine the peach chunks, lemon juice, and sugar in a bowl. Then, stir in the flour and cinnamon.
6. Pour the filling in the pan and refrigrerate it again while you prepare the top crust.
7. Get the other disk from the fridge and roll it on a floured surface. Create a lattice by cutting strips or just top the pie with a full crust circle, it's up to you!
8. In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush the crust. You can also sprinkle some coarse sugar on top.
9. Bake it at 425°F for 20 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Baje it for another 45-50 minutes. If the top is getting too brown, place a sheet of alumminum foil on top of the pie.
10. Remove the pie from the oven, place it on a rack, and let it cool (!). Try to give it 30 minutes.
11. Serve with ice-cream :)
