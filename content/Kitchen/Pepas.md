# Pepas

Pepas are traditional Argentinian cookies. With a buttery short-bread-type base and a sweet filling of your choice, these bite-sized cookies are super easy to make and perfect for tea time. I use <a href="https://elgourmet.com/recetas/pepitas/" target="_blank"> Osvaldo Gross's recipe</a> with a couple of tweaks. 

## Ingredients
- 125 grams of butter
- 125 grams of sugar
- Zest of half a lemon
- Splash of vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 1 yolk
- Pinch of salt
- 270 grams of all-purpose flour
- 10 grams of baking powder
- Aproximately 200 grams of quince paste, guava pasta, dulce de leche, or any desired topping.


## Instructions
- In a mixer or by hand, cream the butter with the sugar. Mix in the lemon zest and vanilla extract.
- Add the egg and yolk and, once incorporated, add the flour, salt, and baking powder, forming a smooth dough.
- Transfer the dough onto a piece of plastic wrtap and shape it into 2-3 cylinders. Wrap them in plastic wrap and chill them in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
- Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Slice the dough cylinders in aproximatly 1 centimeter (a little less than half an inch) thick cookies.  Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between them as they will expand during baking. 
- Make a little hole with your finger in the center of each cookie. Fill the little hole with whatever topping you choose.
- Bake them for 12-15 minutes, depending on your preference.
