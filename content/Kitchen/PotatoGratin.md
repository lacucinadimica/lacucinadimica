This <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017724-cheesy-hasselback-potato-gratin" target="_blank">Kenji López</a> recipe is *so* good. It pairs perfectly with <a href="https://lacucinadimica.com/Kitchen/SalmonFillets" target="_blank">salmon</a>.

The measurements aren't the same Kenji recommends. Just follow your intuition.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup of grated Comté or Gruyère cheese, maybe even a Fontina.
- ½ cup of finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- 1 ½ cups heavy cream
- 1-2 cloves garlic, minced, per preference
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Around 4 pounds russet potatoes
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Procedure
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). 
2. Peel and cut the potatos into ⅛ inch (0.3 cm) thick slices.
3. Combine the cheeses in a large bowl and set aside around ½ cup to sprinkle on top for later. Add the cream, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper.
4. Add the potato slices and toss with your hands until every slice is coated with the cream mixture.
5. Coat the cooking/serving dish with the butter. Organize the potato slices into a stack, from the sides to the center. Make sure it's tightly packed, so slice an extra potato if needed.
6. Pour the excess cream mixture over the potatoes. 
7. Cover the dish with alumminum foil and bake it for 30 minutes. Take out the foil and continue baking for about 30 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the remaining cheese, and return to the oven until golden brown and crisp, about 30 more minutes. Yes, that's around 1.5 hours of baking time. 
9. Let rest for a few minutes, and serve.
