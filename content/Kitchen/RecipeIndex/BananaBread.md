# Walnut Chocolate Chip Banana Bread

I use half of [Gaby Dalkin's recipe](https://whatsgabycooking.com/chocolate-chip-banana-bread-recipe/) with a few tweaks. It yields one regular-size loaf pan bread and it's super easy to make.

## Ingredients
- 3/8 cup (or 6 tablespoons) room temperature unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 2-3 over-ripe bananas, depending on the size
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips

## Procedure
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line up a loaf pan with parchment paper (if you are lazy, or you can just grease and flour it).
2. Mix the room-temperature butter with the sugar until creamy. You can do it on a stand mixer or by hand.
3. Add the egg, making sure everything is well combined.
4. Add the bananas (whole if you are using a mixer, but mash them if you're doing it by hand).
5. Add the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg, mixing just until it's all well combined.
6. Fold the walnuts and chocolate chips.
7. Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for approximately 45 minutes (or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean!)
