# Buttery Flaky Crust

I found this recipe in an old recipe book at home. If you enjoy the taste of butter in a crust, this one is perfect. If you follow the folds, it is flaky too. This dough works for both savory and sweet dishes, which makes it an even better recipe to have.

## Ingredients
- 300 grams all-purpose flour
- 200 grams cold unsalted butter
- 125 cubic centimeters cold water
- Salt

## Procedure
1. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add them to the flour and salt. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs (it's a crumbly, sandy-like mixture). You can also do this with the "flat beater" attachment of a mixer.
2. Add the cold water until you form a dough. 
3. Roll the dough on a floured surface. Fold it in 3, roll it, fold it in 3 again, and roll again. Repeat this as long as you can. Actually, if you let the dough chill before rolling and folding it again, it can be even flakier. 
4. Chill the dough in the fridge covered in plastic wrap before using it for at least 30 minutes. It'll also last in the fridge for 3 days or so.
5. Bake at high heat +400Â°F.
