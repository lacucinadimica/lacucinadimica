# Cappelletti

Cappelletti are a big-time family classic. This is the type of pasta we make for birthdays and other "important" occasions. Cappelletti are prosciutto-filled heart-shaped pasta and they are amazing. Here is my grandma's recipe:

## Ingredients
**Dough**
- 400 grams of flour
- 1 egg
- A pinch of salt
- Water

**Filling**
- 2 tablespoons of oil
- 1/2 an onion
- A small piece of bread soaked in milk.
- 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan
- 50 grams of prosciutto, finely chopped 
- 1 can of deviled ham (you can find it at major grocery stores, but it's not at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's).
- 1 tablespoon of parsley, finely chopped
- 2 egg yolks
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg

## Procedure
**Dough**
- Simply put the ingredients together and form the dough, not too sticky or hard, with the necessary amount of water. Cover it and let it rest.

**Filling**
- Saute the finely chopped onion with the oil, for at least 10 minutes, and remove from the heat. Let cool.
- Soak the small piece of bread in milk until softened, then squeeze out any excess liquid. Combine it with the onion. Add the parmesan, prosciutto, deviled ham, parsley, and 2 egg yolks. 
- Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Combine well.

**Forming the Cappelletti**

- Roll the dough until very thin and cut circles (approximately 5 cm diameter). Place just a little bit of the filling in the middle of the dough circle. Use your finger to cover the border of the circle with a drop of water, ensuring the cappelletti stay close. Fold the dough in a semicircle and bring the two ends together to form the cappelletti.


- Cook them in a big pot of boiling water with plenty of salt. Serve them with a sauce that doesn't overwrite the amazing cappelletti flavor. Sometimes a bit of heavy cream and parmesan is enough.
