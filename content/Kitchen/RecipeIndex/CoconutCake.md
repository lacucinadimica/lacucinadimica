# Torta de Coco de Mamá

This is coconut cake has a thin crust, a layer of dulce de leche, and a coconut topping. It's my mom's recipe, and it's very sweet and very good.

## Ingredients
**Crust**
- 150 grams all-purpose flour
- 100 grams unsalted butter
- 2 eggs
**Layers**
- 500 grams dulce de leche (more or less, depends on the size of your pan)
- 2 eggs
- 150 grams shredded coconut
- 100 grams white sugar

## Procedure
I wrote this recipe and added it to my recipe files in 2019, and of course it only lists the ingredients, because my mom's recipe don't have a procedure. Here is my attempt at explaining what to do:

1. Make a dough with the flour, butter, and 2 eggs. Spread it on a metal pan, preferrably bigger than a typical 9" diamater pan.
2. Add a layer of dulce de leche. The amount will depend on the size of your pan and on your personal preference, but it should be less than half an inch. 
3. Mix 2 eggs, coconut, and sugar with a fork until well combined. Add this mixture as another layer to the cake.
4. Bake for 30-40 minutes at 350°F.
