# Escabeche de Perd√≠z 

If you had so much fun hunting that you ended up with too many birds, this recipe will take care of a few partridges. 

This is my mom's recipe, so there aren't exact quantities: please use your best cooking judgment! Also, feel free to change the vegetables, spices, and herbs based on your personal preference. 

## Ingredients
- 8 partridges
- 3 carrots
- 2 onions
- 1 small bell pepper
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 teaspoon of whole black pepper
- Salt 
- 1 bay leaf
- A small bunch of fresh herbs (e.g., oregano and thyme) 
- 4 cups of sunflower oil
- 2 cups of white vinegar

## Procedure
- Pluk and clean the birds well.
- Put the birds in a big pot, along with the oil, vinegar, bay leaf, whole black pepper, and salt. Cook on medium heat for 1.75-2 hours.
- Add the peeled and sliced carrots, onions, bell pepper, garlic, and a small bunch of herbs. Cook until the vegetables are tender (around 30 min).
- Let it cool completely and store it in an airtight jar or tupper in the fridge.
- Serve cold, along with fresh bread or toast. Bones are removed individually before consumption.
