# Sourdough Bread

I didn't cath the sourdough-madness wave during the pandemic in 2020, but soon enough my curiosity needed me to give this bread a shot. In the fall of 2023, I tried a recipe online, only it didn't work out. The more I researched, the more conflicting opinions I found. So I'll attempt to give a straightfoward guide to sourdough bread here. 

I define sourdough as bread made without store-bought yeast (believe it or not I've found sourdough recipes that asked for dry active yeast). That means that you make your own wild yeast: the sourdough starter.

## The Sourdough Starter

Patience. If I had to describe the whole process in one word, that's what I would choose. You are making a living creature. A starter that's suitable for baking takes +7 days. You will need a bit of whole wheat flour and mainly bread flour.

**General tips**
- Keep your starter in a warm place (75-90F). Inside the oven with the light on is a good place for it.
- Don't close the startes container completely. It needs air to grow. You can cover it with a cloth and tight it with a rubber band.
- You don't have to discard half the starter every time you feed it. But once it starts growing it will overflow if you don't get rid of some of it. Also, if you see a liquid on your starter, you should discard the liquid.

### Ingredients and Equipment 
- Whole wheat flour
- Bread flour
- Warm water
- Patience
- A jar or container (not airtight)
- Cloth and rubber band for covering the jar

### Procedure
1. Mix equal amounts of whole wheat flour and warm water in a jar (say, 70 grams of flour and 70 grams of water). You can just mix it with a fork, making sure that the flour is well incorported. Cover the jar, making sure it is not airtight. Let it rest in a warm place for 24 hrs.
2. Feed the starter with 70 grams of bread flour and 70 grams of warm water. Let it rest for 24 hrs.
3. Discard (yes, just throw away) about half of the starter. Feed it with 70 grams of bread flour and 70 grams of warm water. Let it rest for 24 hrs. Repeat this process for another 4 days.
4. It's been 7 days since step 1. If your starter is bubbly, scoop just a little (around 1 teaspoon) into a glas with room temperature water. If it floats, you can now bake with you starter. If your starter is not bubbly or doesn't pass the float test, keep feeding it for a few more days until it works.
