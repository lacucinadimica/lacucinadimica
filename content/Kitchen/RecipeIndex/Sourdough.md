# Sourdough Bread

I didn't catch the sourdough-madness wave during the pandemic in 2020, but soon enough my curiosity needed me to give this bread a shot. In the fall of 2023, I tried a recipe online, only it didn't work out. The more I researched, the more conflicting opinions I found. So I'll attempt to give a straightforward guide to sourdough bread here. 

For me, sourdough is bread made without store-bought yeast (believe it or not I've found sourdough recipes that asked for dry active yeast). That means that you make your own wild yeast: the sourdough starter.

## The Sourdough Starter

Patience. If I had to describe the whole process in one word, that's what I would choose. You are making a living creature. A starter that's suitable for baking takes +7 days. You will need a bit of whole wheat flour and mainly bread flour.

*General tips*
- Keep your starter in a warm place (75-90F). Inside the oven with the light on is a good place for it.
- Don't close the starter's container completely. It needs air to grow. You can cover it with a cloth and tighten it with a rubber band.
- You don't have to discard half the starter every time you feed it. But once it starts growing it will overflow if you don't get rid of some of it. Also, if you see a liquid on your starter, you should discard the liquid.

**Ingredients and Equipment** 
- Whole wheat flour
- Bread flour
- Warm water
- Patience
- A jar or container (not airtight)
- Cloth and rubber band for covering the jar

**Procedure**
1. Mix equal amounts of whole wheat flour and warm water in a jar (say, 70 grams of flour and 70 grams of water). You can just mix it with a fork, making sure that the flour is well incorporated. Cover the jar, making sure it is not airtight. Let it rest in a warm place for 24 hours.

2. Feed the starter with 70 grams of bread flour and 70 grams of warm water. Let it rest for 24 hours.
3. Discard (yes, just throw away) about half of the starter. Feed it with 70 grams of bread flour and 70 grams of warm water. Let it rest for 24 hours. Repeat this process for another 4 days.
4. It's been 7 days since step 1. If your starter is bubbly, scoop just a little (around 1 teaspoon) into a glass with room-temperature water. If it floats, you can now bake with your starter. If your starter is not bubbly or doesn't pass the float test, keep feeding it for a few more days until it works. 

## Bread-time

There is a lot of science and variables behind sourdough but this recipe makes it as straightforward as possible. It comes from [theBread.Code guy](https://www.the-bread-code.io/recipe/2020/12/22/the-last-sourdough-recipe.html), who a friend recommended.

The whole process takes a minimum of 24 hours, which means your bread will be ready on day 2 or 3 (depending on your preference).

**Equipment**
- Bowl for preparing the dough.
- Banneton or cloth to cover the bowl for the proofing stage.
- V sharp knife for scoring the dough.
- Dutch oven

**Ingredients**
- 400 grams Bread Flour (+12% protein content)
- 100 grams Whole Wheat Flour
- 310-325 grams Water
- 100 grams Sourdough Start
- 10-12 grams Salt
- Rice or semolina flour for the banneton or bowl used in the proofing stage

**Procedure**
1. In the evening of day 1, there are two big steps:
   - Activate your sourdough starter: feed it flour and water on a 1:5:5 ratio. That means, that for 10 grams of starter, you should use 50 grams of (bread) flour and 50 grams of (warm) water. This ratio helps control the acidity. Leave it in a warm spot to resuscitate overnight.
   - Autolize the flour and water: mix both flours and water until it's well combined. Yeah, it's super sticky but don't worry. Cover and let it rest overnight.
2. In the morning of day 2, test if your starter floats in water. If so, add the 100 grams of sourdough starter and salt to the flour and water that you autolyzed last night. Combine very well until the starter is part of the dough (it takes around 5 minutes).
   - If your starter doesn't pass the float test, feed it again and see if it doubles in size in a couple of hours. If it does, test and resume. Otherwise, it's not ready. Give it another day.
3. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes.
4. Now it's time to create dough strength. Place the dough on your counter without any flour. Pull the dough and fold it over so it glues to itself. Repeat until it becomes a nice and smooth dough. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMglhwp2lNs) at minute 14:20 of theBread.code guy.
5. Take a small dough sample (less than a golf ball) and put it at the bottom of a cylindrical container (like a glass). We do this because it's hard to measure how much the big dough rises but it's easy to see that on the small sample. Put a rubber band around the glass to measure the dough height. Cover and let rest in the same spot that you will the other dough. 
    - This sample will tell us when the dough is done fermenting. We are looking for a 40-50% increase in size, which may take 4-8 hours depending on your room temperature. Keep an eye on this little dough as you work through the rest of the steps.
6. Back to the big dough: shape the (recently mutilated) big dough into a round ball. Put it in an air-tight container and let it rest for 2 hours.
7. By now your dough will have flattened out. The next step is coil folding, a weird (but not too complicated) type of folding the dough. It's based on the fact that the dough is sticky and it'll glue to itself. So: wet your hands so you can release the dough from the container. Gently lift it from the center and make the top half stick to itself. Repeat for the bottom side and the sides. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMglhwp2lNs) at minute 18:50 explains it way better.
    - It's important to note that the less you touch the dough the better. You can wait another 2 hours to coil foil the dough again (up to 3 times total) but it may not be necessary. Remember to keep an eye on the little dough.
8. When the sample/little dough has increased its size by 40-50%, it's time to shape the big dough. Flour your counter and flip the dough on it. We don't want to deflate the dough too much, so gently fold the top half of the dough in itself and then glue the bottom half on top. This long rectangle then should be rolled in itself. Keep the shape and pinch the ends closed if you want an oval bread or shape it as a round ball.
9. Proofing stage: flip the dough over (yes, nice side down) into a rice-or-semolina-floured banneton or lined container. Use flour generously here to make sure it doesn't stick to the container. Cover and let rest.
10. Now we need to wait for our dough to pass "the finger poke test". This means that you poke your dough and the dent takes a long time to recover. It will take 2-4 hours at room temperature, but this is where you can finally let the dough help with your schedule. If you have those 2-4 hours to wait and want the bread that night, then let it rest at room temperature. Otherwise, let it rest for only 1 hour and take it to the fridge for upto 24 hours. You can resume the journey at step 12.
11. If you want the bread that night and the dough passed the finger poke test, then place it in the freezer for 45 minutes. Yes, the freezer. We just need it to be cold enough so it's easy to score. After it's been in the freezer for 15'... 
12. Preheat your oven at 465Â°F with the dutch oven in it (and its lid on the side) for 30 minutes.
12. Baking: Carefully flip the dough onto the dutch oven and score it. But the dutch oven lid on and take it to the actual oven for 30 minutes. Then, remove the lif of the dutch oven and let it bake for another 15-20 minutes depending on how dark you want the crust. ENJOY.
