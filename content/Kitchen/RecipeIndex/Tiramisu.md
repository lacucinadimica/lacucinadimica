# Tiramisú del Abuelo

This is my grandpa's tiramisú recipe and the only one that counts. I wrote it in 2017 and the piece of paper is covered in coffee. I love this recipe and can't recommend it enough.

## Ingredients
- Ladyfingers
- 3 4-ounce espressos (4 "piccoli")
- Marsala wine (who knows, plan for 1/4 cup)
- If you have it at hand, use a bit (maybe 1-2 tablespoons) of irish cream liqueur (e.g., Baileys)
- 1 tablespoon unsweetenned cocoa powder
- 3 eggs (separating the whites and yolks)
- 3 tablespoons of sutar
- A pinch of salt
- 400 grams mascarpone cheese
- Some dark chocolate, maybe 1 tablespoon (just to shred on the top)
- Some instant coffe, maybe 1/2 tablespoon (just for the top)

## Procedure
1. Combine the 3 small coffees with the wine in a container where you can soak ladyfingers. If you have some irish cream liqueur too, add 1-2 tablespoons to to the liquid.
2. Layer the bottom of a pan (preferrebly glass or ceramic) with ladyfingers soaked in the coffee and wine liquid. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder on top.
3. To make the filling, you will need to mix two separate batters. If you have two mixers, you will use them simultaneausly here. If you only have one, like all civials, [A] first mix 3 egg yolks (save the whites!) with 3 tablespoons of sugar until it looks creamy. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. Save that mixture, clean your mixing bowl and whisk attachment, and [B] mix the 3 egg whites remaining with a pinch of salt, for approx 10 more minutes.
4. Fold the egg whites into the yolk batter until it's all well-combined. 
5. Add the mascarpone to the mixture (it's easier if it's a room temperature).
6. Pour the mixture on the ladyfingers. Shave some dark chocolate on the top and sprinkle some instant coffee too. 
7. Chill your tiramisú at least overnight. Enjoy!
