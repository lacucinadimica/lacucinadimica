# Walnut Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Muffins

I roasted my Halloween decorations (yes, pumpkins) and I couldn't figure out what to make until I found these [Simply Pumpkin Muffins](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/pumpkin-muffins-recipe/) by Sally's Baking Recipes. I was surprised by how well they turned out, so I'll write down the recipe here (+ my tweaks). You'll get 14-16 regular-sized muffins.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil (I used Sunflower) or melted coconut oil
- 1/2 granulated sugar
- 1/3 light brown sugar (using 1/2 of light brown and then 1/3 of granulated sugar would work well too, just don't cut down on the sugar, because they are the perfect amount of sweet)

- 2 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups fresh pumpkin puree, because I am not doing this recipe unless I have fresh roasted pumpkins. 
- 1/4 cup milk (any works)
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger (I'd also try replacing this with nutmeg)
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (plus a few for decorating the top)
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips (plus a few for decorating the top)

## Procedure
1. Preheat oven to 425F.
2. Whisk the oil, sugars, pumpking puree, eggs, and milk. 
3. Add the dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, ginger, and salt. Combine well.
4. Fold in the chopped walnuts and the dark chocolate chips.
5. Spoon the batter to 90-95% cup. Sprinkle a little light or dark brown sugar on top, plus chocolate chips and walnuts so they look pretty. 
6. Bake for 5 minutes at 425F then reduce the oven to 350F and keep baking for another 17 minutes.
