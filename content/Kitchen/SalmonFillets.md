# Kenji's Ultra-Crisp-Skinned Pan-Roasted Fish Fillets

I learned this technique from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/ultra-crisp-skinned-pan-roasted-salmon-fillets/" target="_blank">Kenji LÃ³pez</a>, and it's so good I had to write it down. I've only used it for salmon, but in theory, it works for any skin-on fish fillets. 

## Ingredients
- Skin-on fish fillets (1 per serving, about 6 ounces each)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Procedure
1. Dry the fillets with paper towels thoroughly. Season them on both sides with salt and pepper. 
2. In a large skillet, heat the oil on medium-high heat until shimmering.
3. Place the fillets, skin-side down, on the skillet and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. Press the fillets gently with a metal spatula to ensure good contact between the skin and the skillet for the first minute (yes, just 1 minute).
4. Let the fish cook for about 5 minutes. Then, if the fillets resist when trying to lift them with the spatula, continue cooking them until they lift easily.
5. Flip the fish and cook skin-side up for about 1 more minute. 
6. Transfer the fish to a paper-towel-lined plate and serve!

Kenji uses a thermometer. I don't, so that's my tweak to the recipe.
