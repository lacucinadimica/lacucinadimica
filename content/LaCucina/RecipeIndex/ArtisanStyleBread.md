# Artisan Style Bread

The easiest, best-looking bread you can make. No kneading required. My sister showed me the original recipe, but oops! I made a few adjustments. It requires a dutch oven and 5-6 hours of rising.

## Ingredients
- 430 grams of all purpose flour
- 6 grams of salt
- 1/2 teaspoons of dry active yeast
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 374 grams of warm water

## Procedure
- In a big bowl, pour the flour, make a hole in the middle, add the sugar, yeast, the water, and let rest for a few minutes. 
- Add the salt and combine well with a spatula. It's going to be sticky. Cover and let rest for 5-6 hrs (maximum 8 hrs) in a warm place.
- Heat up the oven to 425F with the dutch oven in it.
- Sprinkle a bit of flour on your counter, place the dough on it, gently fold it 4 times (without kneading), and coat the dough with flour on the counter.
- Carefully get the dutch oven, put a big piece of partchment paper on the inside, and place the dough on it. "Score" (cut) the top of the bread and prinkle some flour on it.
- Bake the bread in the dutch oven (in the oven!) for 30 minutes with the lid on. 
- Remove the lid and the partchment paper and bake for another 10-20 minutes. Done!
