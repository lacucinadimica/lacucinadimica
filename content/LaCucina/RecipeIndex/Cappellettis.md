# Cappelletti

Big time family classic. This is the type of pasta we make for birthdays and other "important" ocassions. Cappelletti are proscioutto-filled heart-shaped pasta and they are amazing. Here is my grandma's recipe:

## Ingredients
**Dough**
- 400 grams of flour
- 1 egg
- A pinch of salt
- Water

**Filling**
- 2 tablespoons of oil
- 1/2 an onion
- A small piece of bread soaked in milk and then squeezed.
- 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan
- 50 grams of proscioutto, finely chopped 
- 1 can of deviled ham (you can find it at major grocery stores, but it's not at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's).
- 1 tablespoon of parsley, finely chopped
- 2 egg yolks
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg

## Procedure
**Dough**
- Simply put the ingredients together and form a dough, not too sticky and not too hard, with the necessary amount of water. Cover and let it rest.

**Filling**
- Saute the finely chopped onion with the oil, for at least 10 minutes, and remove from the heat. Let cool.
- Combine the onion with the piece of bread soaked in milk and then squeezed. Add the parmesan, proscioutto, deviled ham, parsley, and 2 egg yolks. 
- Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Combine well.
