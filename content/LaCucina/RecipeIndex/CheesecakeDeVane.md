# Cheesecake de Vane

Vane's cheesecake is the only no-bake cheesecake I can recommend. I had just a few notes on this recipe, so it took me way longer than expected to explain it all.  

## Ingredients
- 465 grams of cream cheese (CasanCrem if you are in Argentina)
- 150 grams of heavy cream
- 150 grams of sugar
- 85 grans of unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons of lemon zest
- 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- 1 envelope of unflavored gelatin (7.2 grams)
- 160 grams of vanilla crackers (Lincoln if you are in Argentina)
- Your choice of berries

## Procedure
- Process the crackers and add the melted butter. Incorporate well and use the mixture to make a crust in a 9" springform pan. 
- Bake in a 350F oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.
- In a bowl, mix the room-temperature cream cheese, sugar, lemon zest, vanilla extract. 
- Hydrate gelatine: Sprinkle it on a small bowl with approximately 3 tablespoons of water, add some boiling water, and stir until it is completely dissolved.
- Add the dissolved gelating to the mixture in the bigger bowl. Mix by hand making sure it stays a homogeneous, making sure there are no lumps. 
- Separately, mix the heavy cream just enough so it's a little more solid and fold it into the main mixture. 
- Pour the mixture on the crust and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
- Serve along with berries. But Mica would also do something different: before refrigerating the cheesecake, I would top it off with a layer of berries. I'd prepare that berry-layer by heating them up in a small pan just enough so that they are not whole (and adding a little lemon or orange zest). I'd add a tablespoon or two of any jam you have in the fridge and another hydrated unflavored gelatin. I'd pour it on top of the cheesecake and then send to the fridge.
