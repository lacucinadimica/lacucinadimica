# Ham & Cheese Quiche

This is another "invento puro y absoluto", which translates to "a pure and absolute invention", but simply means I came up with the recipe. Lots of freedom for this quiche (or tart if you prefer) and here is the basic structure:

## Ingredients  
**Filling:**
- 1 Onion: any works, but the sweeter the better. One red onion, one sweet onion, or 2 shallots work best.
- Ham: at least 4 slices.
- Cheese: same amount as the ham plus a couple of tbls of cream cheese. For the hard cheeses, I like using a combination of strong and mild ones, for example: goat cheese, mozzarella, and parmesan.
- 5 Eggs: you can use more or less. The more eggs you use the the more of a quiche it will be and less eggs make it more like a tart.
- Salt, black pepper, nutmeg, and oregano. Other spices work here too, e.g., a little dehydrated onion works well.
- Hot sauce: a splash of a good sauce will add a kick that makes for a nice final touch. 
**Mirta's Dough:**
This is a key dough to learn for making tarts and empanadas. It can be flaky if folded enough and it tastes great. Here is what you need:
- 2 Cups of Flour (all purpose will be the best, but whole wheat works too).
- 1/4 Cups of Oil (any vegatable oil works, but I recommend sunflower).
- 1/2 Cups of Boiling Water. 
- A bit of cornstarch for rolling the dough. 
- Salt.

## Procedure
- Make the dough by simply combining the ingredients above. Don't add any extra flour after you form the dough, use cornstarch for rolling it instead. Roll it, fold it in 3, roll it again, fold it in 4, and roll it one more time and fold it in 3 again. Keep folding and rolling for more flakiness. Put the rolled dough on the desired dish for the quiche (if it's a metal pan, the dough will be crispier).
- Saute the onion until it's cooked through (min. 15'). Remove from the heat and let cool.
- While the onion is cooking, dice the ham and hard cheeses. Separately, beat the eggs with the salt and spices.
- Ones the onion is cool, combine the ham, cheeses (including cream cheese), and the onion in a separate bowl. Then add the eggs and make sure it's all well combined. 
- Bake it a 400F oven for at least 30 minutes or until the filling is set.
