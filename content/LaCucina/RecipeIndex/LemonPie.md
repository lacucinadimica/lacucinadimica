Because this is my mom's lemon pie recipe, there are only a couple of rules to be followed here. The lack of rules can make this more complicated than it has to, but don't let that happen. If you are looking for a recipe that doesn't require much precision to have fun tweaking and improving, this is it. 

Just try to enjoy the freedom of the recipe. Use your judgement on quantities (the dough may require exta flour).

## Ingredients
**Crust**
- 200 grams of all-purpose flour
- 100 grams of unsalted butter at room temperature
- 1 tablespoons of sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 eggs
- 1 lemon's zest
- A splash of vanilla extract

**Filling**
- 3 eggs (1 full, 2 yolks)
- 100 grams of sugar
- 1/4 cup of cornstarch (you can use 2 tablespoons of flour if you don't have cornstarch)
- 3 lemons 

**Italian Meringue**
- 3 egg whites 
- 210 grams of sugar

## Procedure
- Make the crust: mix the butter and sugar until well combined. Add the 2 eggs, 1 egg yolk, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Add the flour until you form a dough. Don't knead it and try to touch it the least amount possible. Seal with plastic wrap and refrigerate. You can alwasy make the dough 1-2 days ahead.
- For the filling, whisk 2 yolks and a full egg (or 3 yolks, up to you) with the sugar. I usually whisk this in a the same pot I'll use for making the filling. Add the zest of three lemons and squeeze the juice of 2 of those. Combine well.
- Separately, disolve the cornstarch in water (around 1/2 liter). 
- Place the pot with the filling on medium heat and stir. Slowly add the disolved cornstarch. Stir from time to time, making sure that it doesn't stick to the bottom and that the mixture is homogeneous.
- Bake the dough on a 350F oven. Let it cool for a bit (5-10 minutes), while you start on the meringue, and the pour the filling on the crust.
- Make the Italian meringue by following [these steps](MerengueItaliano). When it's ready, top your lemon pie with it.
