The Marquise is a cake with a chocolate base, a layer of dulce de leche, another of whipped cream, and (as it wasn't enough) Italian meringue on top. It's **very** rich, great dessert for people with a sweet tooth who love chocolate. I use [Maru Botana's recipe](https://www.marubotana.tv/recipe-items/marquise-de-chocolate/) but I either do 1/4 or 3/8 of the quantities because it's a bomb otherwise.

It's also an easy-to-make-but-very-nice-looking cake, so it makes for a great birthday present (this is my friend Martin's's favorite cake, so he knows!). It can also easily be made gluten-free, which is a plus. 

Here is Maru's recipe broken down in 3/8:

## Ingredients
- 150 grams of butter
- 112 grams of dark chocolate
- 3/4 cups of suga
- 3 eggs
- 3/4 tablespoon of all-purpose flour (or cornstarch if you're making it gluten-free!)
- 180 grams of dulce de leche
- 75 grams of heavy cream (Note: I sometimes skip the heavy cream layer, but beacuse it doesn't take any sugar, I mostly keep it, your call)

**For the Italian Meringue:**
- 150 grams of sugar
- 75 grams of egg whites
- 150 grams of water

## Procedure
- Melt the chocolate, butter, and sugar in a water bath. I know we all just want to use the microwave, but it's actually not that bad, try to enjoy it!
- Take it out of the heat, add the eggs, and mix by hand so it's all well incorporated. Add the flour/cornstarch and mix well.
- Grease and flour a 9" pan, pour the mixture, and bake on a 350F oven until the edges start to unstick from the pan.
- Let it cool completely and take it out of the pan.
- For the meringue, follow this [Italian Merigue notes](MerengueItaliano).
- Time to put the Marquise together: top the chocolate layer with the dulce de leche, a very fine layer of freshly whipped heavy cream (with no sugar unless you want to die), and finish it with the meringue.
