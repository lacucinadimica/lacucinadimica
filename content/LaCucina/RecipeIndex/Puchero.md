# Puchero de Mam√°

This is a family classic. It's a type of stew with meat and vegetables. We would have Puchero every Monday growing up because it also gives you a Spanish tortilla for dinner and broth for the rest of the week (I'll add notes on this). When I moved away at 18, this is the first recipe that asked my mom about. For me, it tastes like home, and however simple, there are only a few other meals that makes me as happy. 

I have to admit that when I was young I was tired of having Puchero so often. But now I haven't only realized how rich-in-flavor and healthy it is, I also miss it dearly.

As I have mentioned regarding family recipes, lots can change depending on availability. So as long as you have the first 5 ingredients, you can replace the rest or change the quantities if preferred.

My mom's recipe feeds 4 people on day 1 but more if you are strategic and it's the only recipe that exists for me:

## Ingredients
- Ossobuco (cross-cut veal shanks) or short-ribs (it just needs to be beef and have bone)
- 3 carrots (2 whole and 1 grated)
- 1/3 cup of chopped parsley (approximately, plan for a good handful)
- 1 stalk of celery
- 1 stalk of leek
- 1 bunch of green onions
- 1 full onion (any works, but I have never seen red onions in Puchero)
- 1 tomato 
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 potato
- 1 sweet potato (I like Japanese sweet potato or "batata)
- 1 ear of corn (I usually do 2 of these because I love corn from Puchero)
- 1 small butternut squash or pumpkin
- 1 zapallito del tronco (very hard to find in the U.S. but has to be added to the list of ingredients, it doesn't make much of a difference so don't worry if you can't get it.)
- Salt, a little dry oregano, some pepper, and a bay leaf.

3 carrots (2 whole and 1 grated)

the bone in the meat makes it for a better broth

mom has added some basil 
carcasa de Pollo
