A collection of my engineering projects, in reverse chrnological order.


## Electrosurgical Generator Electromechanical Load
### Fall 2021 - Spring 2022

- Description: This was my Senior Year Project. The goal was to create a system that allowed Medtronic to test its electrosurgical generators. Via the engineering design process, we built a lead screw actuator with an electrode arm to replicate the generatorâ€™s arcing behavior in monopolar mode (dissection and coagulation), and a variable load using a saline bath to copy the varying tissue impedance in bipolar mode (vessel sealing). 
- My role: I was the Project Manager. Some of my responsibilities were to guide the project toward success (by assuring compliance to requirements),  balance stakeholders (client, director, and class executives), manage resources (time & work distribution), and keep the team aligned towards the project's goals.

## Electronic General
### Fall 2020

- Description: This was the final project for "Circuit for Engineers". It was an electronic version of the game Generala, also known as Yahtzee or dice Poker.  The dice were represented by a circuit of 4060 microcontrollers and 6 LEDs each, showing the rolled value. A push-button is used to "roll" the dice. A counter system made of LEDs showed the time left in the game. A PCB divided the power from two 9V batteries into the counter and the dice portions of the project.
- My role: I planned and built all circuitry. I was also the team leader, setting the vision and milestones for the project.


## Thermo Guard
### Fall 2020

- Desciption: Thermo Guard was a project for "Enginereing Projects 3: Invention and Innovation". This project involved creating a fictional business around a product and them building such product.
- My role: I was the CFO, but apart from my financial duties, I was in charge of the programming and circuitry of the Thermo Guard. It was a device that sends data to an app, informing cooks about the state of the food, allowing users to "cook outside the kitchen".

## MeasureIt
### Fall 2020

-Description: This was the final project for "Data Analysis for Engineers". As a passionate baker (and cook), I have heard multiple well-know bakers recommending metal pans for baking brownies "evenly" across the pan. However, my personal experience said that glass or ceramic pans made for brownes with better "moisture". I set the purpose of this project was to test that hypothesis: to identify how the pan material affects the overall humidity of the brownies and evaluate how humidity changes across the different locations of the slice. We used a humidity sensor to measure the brownie's humidy for glass, ceramic, and metal plans and across the brownie slice (border, middle, and center). It was found that there was no statistical difference between ceramic and glass pans, and these were different from metal pans. Moreover, there was no statistical difference across the slice for none of the pan materials.

- My Role: As the team leader, I was responsible for roadmapping the project. Moreover, I baked all 9 batches (3 for each pan material) and helped with the measurements and data analysis.
